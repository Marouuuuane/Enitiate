	<h1 class="SIS"> China: The US has started 'the biggest trade war' in history
</h1>
	<p>The Trump administration's 25% tariffs affect more than 800 Chinese products worth $34 billion such as industrial machinery, medical devices and auto parts. They kicked in just after midnight ET, which is noon in Beijing.</p>
	<h3 class="SOS"> China's tariffs on US goods came into effect immediately afterward, a spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry said Friday.</h3>
	<p> Trump and his advisers argue the tariffs are necessary to pressure China into abandoning unfair practices such as stealing intellectual property and forcing American companies to hand over valuable technology.

	Beijing insists it's the injured party.

	"China is forced to strike back to safeguard core national interests and the interests of its people," the Commerce Ministry said in a statement on Friday. It accused the United States of "typical trade bullying."

	The government said previously it would hit more than 500 US export items — including cars and major agricultural goods such as soybeans and meat — worth the same as the Chinese products targeted by the United States.</p>
	<h3>I don't know what to do anymore !</h3>

		<li>Whereas President Trump has refused to divest, place into a blind trust, or otherwise give up his ownership interest in his worldwide business holdings since becoming President</li>
		<li>Whereas President Trump has refused to release his tax returns, in a break from the practice of United States Presidents for more than 40 years;</li>
		<li>Whereas, on February 14, 2017, the Chinese Government registered a trademark to Donald John Trump for branded construction services, following a 10-year legal battle that turned in Donald John Trump’s favor after he declared his candidacy for President of the United States;</li>
		<li>Whereas President Trump did not first seek or obtain the consent of Congress before accepting any of these trademark benefits from China;</li>
